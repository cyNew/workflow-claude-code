# Development Workflow Integration

This project uses the `workflow` plugin. The plugin provides a structured development pipeline through the `/task` command.

## Workflow Mode

The workflow mode is controlled by a flag file at the project root:

- **Enabled**: When `.workflow-enabled` file exists, ALL development tasks (bug fixes, feature requests, new projects) MUST follow the full workflow: understand requirement → assess impact → determine size (small/large/new-project) → execute the corresponding pipeline. This applies even when the user describes the task in natural language without using `/task`.
- **Disabled (default)**: When `.workflow-enabled` does not exist, work normally. The `/task`, `/implement`, `/review`, and `/ship` commands are still available for explicit use, but no automatic workflow is enforced.

To toggle:
- Enable: `touch .workflow-enabled`
- Disable: `rm .workflow-enabled`

## Quick Reference

When workflow mode is enabled and you receive a development task:

1. Check if the requirement is clear. If not, ask ONE clarifying question.
2. Quick triage: if the task is obviously trivial (≤2 files, single module, no DB/API changes), skip to step 5.
3. Scan the codebase for impact (files, modules, APIs, DB, dependencies).
4. Produce an Impact Summary and classify as small / large / new-project.
5. Follow the corresponding pipeline:
   - **Trivial**: implement directly → verify → report (no task record)
   - **Small**: delegate to coder → test → self-review → report
   - **Large**: decompose into sub-tasks → confirm plan → execute each as small → integration review
   - **New project**: propose architecture → confirm → decompose into milestones → execute
6. After all changes, ask before committing.

When workflow mode is disabled, simply help the user with whatever they ask, using the plugin commands only when explicitly invoked.

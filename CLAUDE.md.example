# Development Workflow Integration

This project uses the `workflow` plugin. The plugin provides a structured development pipeline through the `/task` command.

## Workflow Mode

The workflow mode is controlled by a flag file at the project root:

- **Enabled**: When `.workflow-enabled` file exists, ALL development tasks (bug fixes, feature requests, new projects) MUST follow the full workflow: understand requirement → assess impact → determine size (small/large/new-project) → execute the corresponding pipeline. This applies even when the user describes the task in natural language without using `/task`.
- **Disabled (default)**: When `.workflow-enabled` does not exist, work normally. The `/task`, `/implement`, `/review`, and `/ship` commands are still available for explicit use, but no automatic workflow is enforced.

To toggle:
- Enable: `touch .workflow-enabled`
- Disable: `rm .workflow-enabled`

## Quick Reference

When workflow mode is enabled and you receive a development task:

1. Check if the requirement is clear. If not, ask ONE clarifying question.
2. Scan the codebase for impact (files, modules, APIs, DB, dependencies).
3. Produce an Impact Summary and classify as small / large / new-project.
4. Follow the corresponding pipeline:
   - **Small**: implement → test → self-review → report
   - **Large**: decompose into sub-tasks → confirm plan → execute each as small → integration review
   - **New project**: propose architecture → confirm → decompose into milestones → execute
5. After all changes, ask before committing.

When workflow mode is disabled, simply help the user with whatever they ask, using the plugin commands only when explicitly invoked.
